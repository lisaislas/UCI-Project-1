## Lets Eat!

### Hypothesis:
How does a person's external environment and influences affect people's eating habits and perception of food?

### Questions:
We want to look at several questions that we came up with when looking at our data set:
1. How often do the students cook and exercise
    a. Any correlation between gender and exercise regimen?
    b. Does playing sports affect how often you exercise?
    c. Does living situation affect how often someone cook?
2. How does parents' education influence earing habits?
    a. Any correlation between parents' education and student's eating habits?
    b. Are there any correlations between parents' education and how frequently they cook at home?
    c. Is there any type of conclusion we can reach if we compare how frequently the students cook, if their parents cook, or how often they eat out?
    d. Is there any type of correlation between a student's weight and how frequently they eat out?
    
## Conclusions:
Ultimately, we cannot use the data to suggest there are any correlations between our data and the relationships we were expecting to find in them. There were no significat correlations found where we could make any signification claims in our data since they were too close to 0. There appears to be no correlation between the parents' level of education and how frequently they eat out or how their children's (the students) eating habits.
